                    Architecture is both the process and the product of planning, designing, and constructing buildings and other physical structures. It blends functionality with aesthetics, creating spaces that are both practical and beautiful, and reflecting cultural and technological advancements.
                    <br>
                    The art of architecture involves balancing technical requirements with artistic vision, environmental considerations, and social impact. Architects must consider factors such as sustainability, accessibility, and urban planning to create buildings that enhance the quality of life for occupants and communities. Architecture is a form of expression that shapes the way we live, work, and interact with the built environment, making it a fundamental aspect of human civilization.
