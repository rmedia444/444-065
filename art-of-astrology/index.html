                    Astrology is the belief and study of the movements and relative positions of celestial bodies as having an influence on human affairs and the natural world. It examines the relationship between the positions of the stars and planets and events on Earth, offering insights into personality traits, relationships, and future events based on astrological charts and interpretations.

                    The art of astrology has a long history and is practiced in various forms around the world. Astrologers use birth charts and celestial alignments to provide guidance and predictions, believing that the positions of the planets can influence individual lives and global events. Astrology is a deeply personal and cultural practice, offering people a sense of connection to the cosmos and a framework for understanding themselves and the world around them.
